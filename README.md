# Gastronomy_Tales_VR


Synopsis:\
Inspried by the Eritrean Coffee Ceremony that a friend was kind enough to invite me to, I wanted to create a cooking game that taught not only how to make recipes, but the stories and history behind them and the places the came from. It would combine a simplified, but accurate cooking model while integrating enteraining npcs that would help teach you how to cook while also talking about their lives and where they came from.

Purpose:\
* Figure out how to make an efficent cooking system that's expandable
* Develop in game cinematics and npc interactions
* Working on modeling different real world locals
* Animate in game characters that respond to you and each other

Software and Equipment:
* Unity Engine - C#, XR Interactive Toolkit
* Blender
* Oculus Rift S or Oculus Link
